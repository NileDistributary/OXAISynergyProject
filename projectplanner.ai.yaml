          You are given a set of ramblings above about different elements of a project. Your task is to organize these thoughts into a small, coherent report. The report should include the following sections:
            1) Project Summary: A brief overview of the project based on the information provided.
            2) Timeline Overview: An organized timeline of the tasks mentioned (Use standard units of time, convert if needed).
            3) Sequence: Arrange the tasks mentioned into the best likely sequence based on logical order and dependencies.
            4) Total Project Duration
            Ensure that the report is clear, concise, and logically organized.

          Based on the organized report, identify the key tasks and their details. Organize these tasks into three separate arrays: one for the task names, one for the durations, and one for the order of execution.

    # Specify a JSONschema for structured output
    output_schema:
      # An example of this output is:
      # {
      #   "tasks": ["Task 1", "Task 2"],
      #   "durations": ["Duration 1", "Duration 2"],
      #   "order": [1, 2]
      # }
